Q. What is this?!
A. This is Twitch Plays Choice Chamber. I wrote this with the help of you people (specifically, [Sojobo](https://twitch.tv/Sojobo) and [yanneves_](https://twitch.tv/yanneves_). Yes that is all at the moment but you can help too! Come help me out [here](https://github.com/jbmagination/TwitchPlaysCC))

Q. Why did you make this?
A. Choice Chamber allows people to control the EVENTS of the game, not the PLAYERS. So I decided to finally write that. And when I did, I found out Bean had done this already on April Fools Day of 2014. So I guess I just rewrote that :P

Q. Wait, PLAYERS?
A. Yes, there are two players. Try pressing F2 if you own the game, and watch the magic unfold.

Q. I'm stuck! Can you help me?
